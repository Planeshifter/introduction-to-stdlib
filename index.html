					Hello everyone, my name is Philipp Burckhardt. I am a statistician trained at Carnegie Mellon University. Please don't expect too much from me: as the joke among statistician's goes, the difference between the extroverted and the introverted statistician is that the former looks at <e>your</e> shoes when talking to you.

				<h1>An introduction to stdlib</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Another complication: this talk is about a piece of fundamental technology, which is deeply rooted in programming essentials, algorithms, and mathematics. However, since the library I am going to talk about may abstract away painstaking routine tasks,it may come handy to you in building your own applications and allow you and your team to focus on your main goals.

				<h1 class="white no-text-transform">Why another library?</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Myself, when I am confronted with some new technology, my first question always is: Why another library? One has to have a very good reason for investing the time and effort to learn something new. Every dependency one relies on is a liability, especially with the risk of people abondoning their projects or otherwise deserting them.

				<label class="white">Source: <a class="white" href="http://www.modulecounts.com/">http://www.modulecounts.com/</a> (Erik DeBill)</label>
				<aside class="notes">
					But even if I was convinced that the library in question was a serious undertaking and not a weekend project, I would ask myself: Isn't there a comparable library already built, which might have more users and be even of better quality. As of today, the Node.js package manager offers around 700,000 packages for any imaginable task.

				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">package discovery</li>
					<li class="fragment">packages of varying quality</li>
					<li class="fragment">no consistent interfaces</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					In spite of this enormous supply, there are some serious disadvantages: First, you need to spend time to evaluate the available packages and inspect their quality as there are often multiple solutions for a given problem. Metrics such as the number of downloads or the number of stars on GitHub are unreliable indicators, so most of the time the only proper thing to do is to inspect the source code.Second, piecing together various utilities may cause headaches due to different interfaces that might not well play together.

						I imagine that you are already using some utility libraries to make your lifes easier, be it jQuery to interact with the DOM or something like underscore or lodash to streamline common tasks. If you are interested in functiontal programming, you might have worked with ramda. Or maybe you eschew such libraries and just use the new language features that came with ES6.

				<aside class="notes">
					Due to the history of JS as a front-end language, it becomes more and more lonely the more abstract territory one enters. However, with the rise of Node.js, a lot of new applications for JS got into sight, for example server programming and command-line utilities. Popular noSQL databases use JavaScript as a scripting language in their clients, and with electron you can now build desktop applications that run on all operating systems. The Internet of Things opens new territory with smart devices, which integrate sensors and collect data that can be analyzed later on.

				<h4 class="fragment no-text-transform">The built-in JavaScript libraries are limited</h4>
				<aside class="notes">
					Here is the point where our library comes into play. As we have seen, JavaScript offers a plethora of useful utility libraries, but in terms of fundamental building blocks, thoroughly tested and reliable mathematical routines, there are still many blank spots.
					My colleague Athan Reines and I were quite surprised when we found out that some of the standard Math object functions returned inaccurate results when tested against reference implementations in other languages. And while meanwhile most of these issues have been fixed, different browsers might return different results for the same function due to different algorithms.
					This may be due to the history of JavaScript, where accuracy has often been traded for modest performance gains and a development which can only be characterized as mercurial.
					The situation is much worse for userland implementations for many mathematical routines: quite often, they are written by people who need them for their own project, but have no relevant expertise and are thus not aware what a proper implementation should offer.
					For us, this demonstrated the need for a thoroughly tested, reliable, and well documented library that is rooted in science and implements everything from the ground-up. That's why we built this library and are calling it stdlib.

					Athan Reines and I have started development of stdlib in 2016. In the first year, we implemented around 800 packages. In 2017, almost a thousand additional packages made their way into stdlib and we are now on the brink of implementing many building blocks that will turn JavaScript into a language suitable for data science.
					This field is likely to become more and more important for programmers. This gives me room for a question: Who of you has done any data analysis and data science so far? Raise your hand please. (make comment)

					What does stdlib contain? First, all the utilities you would expect from a standard library in another programming language. Second (...). As of today, stdlib contains more than 2,000 functions which include unit tests, benchmarks, and full documentation. For every line of source code, we write another 5-6 lines of test code and another 3-4 lines of benchmark/example code. Additionally, we have JSDoc annotations as well as README files for each function, which easily surpass the 80,000 lines of code of the library.

				<h1>Design Principles</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					One of the fundamental questions that we have asked ourselves time and time again is: What does it need to create a good, reliable piece of technology that will resist the test of time?
					Early on, we settled on a few core design principles that have shaped our development.

				<h2>Decomposability</h2>
				<div class="fragment">
					<ul>
						<li>each package can consumed and understood independently of the project</li>
						<li>every package maintains resource locality</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes" data-timing="30">
					First, every function in stdlib is its own package and can be used individually. This approach, which is inspired by the Unix philosophy, encourages a highly modular design that avoids lumping together functionality. This avoids unnecessary overhead, makes testing and reasoning about your code easier. All together, such an approach leads to clean, transparent, and simple user-facing APIs. It also allows the user to customize the library to his own needs.

						In ES5, the standard math library consisted of 18 functions and 8 constants. These functions can be categorized as trigonometric, other special functions, including rounding, and miscellaneous, including a PRNG.
					</p>
					<p>
						ES2015/ES6 added 17 more functions to the standard math library. Again, these functions are broken down into trigonometric, other special functions, including rounding, and miscellaneous.
					</p>
					<p>
						The addition of these 17 functions means the JavaScript standard math library has 35 functions.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, the JavaScript standard math library is quite small, especially when compared to other languages and dedicated numeric computing environments.
					</p>
					<p>
						In comparison, the Golang standard math library has 54 functions (JS has 35), 8+ PRNGs, as well as support for 64-bit and 128-bit complex numbers. Notably, Golang has equivalents for most C/C++ standard math library functions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Besides being small, the JavaScript standard math library has other problems.

							ECMA-262 does not specify particular math algorithms (only recommends); hence implementors are free to choose algos according to speed/precision trade-offs.

						<li>
							ECMA-262 does not require a minimum precision; hence, no guarantee that a given JavaScript environment has a precise implementation.
						</li>
						<li>
							Portability is non-existent for numeric computing applications due to potential cross-browser variability and potential variability from one browser version to the next.
						</li>
						<li>
							No common codebase, so resolving issues takes considerable time and effort, especially when different vendors use varying implementations in varying languages with varying organization and structure.
						</li>
						<li>
							Specification-level changes require cross-browser vendor consensus, causing the pace of innovation at the standards level to be slow (e.g., U/Int64 support has been on the table, off the table for more than a decade, and is most recently on the table as part of a BigInt proposal).

						Admittedly, the error is only 3 ulp; however, those 3 ulp matter. Inaccurate results for integer inputs a) is counterintuitive because 10**308 is representable as a double (so not the same counterintuitive as 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3) and b) ends up causing downstream accuracy issues for higher order mathematical functions as we discovered while writing such functions.
