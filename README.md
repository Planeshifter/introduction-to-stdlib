# Introduction to stdlib.js

> Slides for my talk at the [International JavaScript Conference (iJS)][ijs].


## Abstract

The core JavaScript language is lacking much of the functionality that other programming languages provide as part of their standard libraries. In this talk, Philipp Burckhardt will introduce stdlib, a collaborative effort that comes with >1500 functions built to address this gap. The functions range from basic utilities to complex statistical models to machine learning and numeric analysis. Usage of stdlib offers several benefits over currently available options from the npm ecosystem: high quality, rigorous, and robust implementations, consistent interfaces, an enterprise-friendly open-source license, extensive documentation, and complete unit-tests. More importantly, stdlib brings much needed functionality for scientific computing and machine learning to JavaScript and Node.js. Modern JavaScript engines bring unmatched performance benefits compared to traditional numeric computing languages such as Python and R, and Node.js Addons and WebAssembly allow building high-performance interfaces to native C/C+ code, thus creating a suitable platform for numeric computation.
